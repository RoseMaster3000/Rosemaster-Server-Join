# Minecraft Daily Login Bonus
I wrote this simple mod that gives an item to a player every day that they join my server.

## Command Block Cons
* Command blocks check the player list every tick. This is resource intensive.
* Command blocks must be placed in the world manully / hidden under bedrock
* Command blocks need to be in a loaded chunk to function
